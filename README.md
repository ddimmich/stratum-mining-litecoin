#Description
Stratum-mining is a pooled mining protocol. It is a replacement for *getwork* based pooling servers by allowing clients to generate work. The stratum protocol is described [here](http://mining.bitcoin.cz/stratum-mining) in full detail.

This is a implementation of stratum-mining for scrypt based coins. It is compatible with *mmcfe-ng* as well as *mmcfe*, as it complies with the standards of *pushpool*. The end goal is to build on these standards to come up with a more stable solution.

The goal is to make a reliable stratum mining server for scrypt based coins. Over time I will develop this to be more feature rich and very stable. If you would like to see a feature please file a feature request. 

**NOTE:** This fork is still in development. Many features may be broken. Please report any broken features or issues.

* This fork (ddimmich) adds postgresql support back in.
